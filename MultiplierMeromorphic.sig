S,LogResolutionMeromorphic,Computes the weighted cluster of base points of a bivariate meromorphic ideal (f/g),0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,469,,0,0,469,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,MultiplierIdealsMeromorphic,"Computes the Multiplier Ideals and their associated Jumping Numbers for a meromorphic function f/g, using the algorithm of Alberich-Alvarez-Gomez. Returns a list of tuples of the form: <jumping number, <fExponent, generators>>. The multiplier ideal represented by this data is: f^fExponent * (generators). If ComputeIdeals is set to false, the output tuples are: <jumping number , 0>",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,469,,0,0,469,,168,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
